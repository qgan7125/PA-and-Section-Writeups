# PA5-HashMapImpl-Key (Status: Draft 2/17/18 2:45pm)

Writeup for PA5.


## Learning Objectives

The goal of this assignment is to use two or more datastructures
in a coordinated way to solve a problem.

The problem to be solved in this assignment is to implement a 
HashMap. Therefore an additional learning objective is to 
increase your skill level with HashMaps from just being able 
to use them to understanding how to implement them.

The dictionary abstract data type can be used to solve many
programming problems and therefore questions about hash tables 
frequently occur in job interviews.

## The Assignment

You will be redoing PA2-HashMap with your own HashMap implementation
called MyHashMap.  Here are the key components of this assignment:

  * PA5Test.java with JUnit tests of all the functionality MyHashMap needs to 
    provide to implement PA2.  The tests can be written for HashMap and then 
    edited slightly to be used to test MyHashMap instead.  Implementing them
    first will help the development of MyHashMap be more test driven.

  * MyHashMap.java with an implementation of a generic, MyHashMap class.
    Your hashmap should only have 10 buckets.

  * PA5Main.java with an edited version of PA2Main.java that...
    * uses MyHashMap instead of the HashMap provided in java.util

    * provides a DEBUG command that outputs the printTable() information
      about conflicts in a table that maps flight codes to integers

    * has been improved based on PA2 code clarity and decomposition feedback
      and follows the more stringent grading criteria specified below
      
    * does some error checking on the input file and skips bad lines


## JUnit implementation

The PA5Test.java file should contain unit tests for all of the HashMap
functionality your PA2 program uses.  We strongly recommend you write
the tests for HashMap first.  They should all pass.  Then replace HashMap
with MyHashMap and you can test MyHashMap as you implement it.

For grading, we will look for unit test cases for at least the following:
  * put
  * get
  * containsKey
  * keySet
  * collisions, see below
  * printTable, see below

## Hash Map Implementation

A hash table is a data structure that offers quick O(1) operations such 
as inserting data and searching for data. You have used a form of a 
hash table when using the HashMap class in Java. However, in this 
assignment you will implement your own version of a hash map.

### Hash Map Background
First, you should read up on what a hash table is. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) is a good place to start.

At its heart a hash table (hash map) is an array that works together 
with a function, known as a hash function, that takes a key and returns 
an index into that array. We usually call the elements in the array 
buckets.  This is because when more than one element maps to the same
array location (or bucket), there needs to be some organization for keeping
all those elements there and being able to find them.

A critical part of writing a good
hash map implementation is writing a good (and appropriate) hash function. 
It should spread out values evenly based on different input values 
and needs to always produce the same value if the same element is given to it.

There are multiple ways to implement a hash map, here are a three:
  * An array that contains a linked list for each bucket
  * A linked list that contains a linked list for each bucket (2d linked list)
  * An array that contains an array for each bucket (a 2d array)

You can use one of these methods or use a different one to implement
your HashMap, which should be called MyHashMap.

### A Generic MyHashMap class

You will create a class called MyHashMap that maps keys to values.
To enable the construction and use of MyHashMap for any provided
key and value types, you will implement it as a generic class.

This is done by declaring MyHashMap with type parameters.
```
    class MyHashMap<K,V> {
        ...
    } 
```
Throughout the rest of the class definition, the capital letter 'K' will
be used to declare variables of the key type, and the capital letter 'V'
will be used to declare variables of the value type.

See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html
for more information.

### The Hash Function

For this assignment, you will be implementing your own HashMap class using the following hash function.
		
  1. Find the hash code of that object (look into the hashCode method)
  2. Mod it by the number of buckets  
  3. Then take its absolute value.

Here is the code for the hash function.  You can use this code directly
in your implementation:
```
	private int hash(K key) {
		int hashCode = key.hashCode();
		int index = hashCode % numBuckets;
		return Math.abs(index);
	}
```

### Handling collisions

This hash map will use chaining to handle the collisions of elements.
Your hash map should only have 10 buckets!  Collisions will happen.
We will be covering this in class.



## Error checking

You **WILL** need to error check. This involves checking to see if a line 
in the input file is valid. If it is not a valid
line, skip it. You know a line is invalid if there is 
no comma in it. (hint hint) 

## The DEBUG command

The program should be able to accept the DEBUG command on the command line after
the input file name.  That output should show how all of the airport codes
in the input file map into indices in the hash table.

The DEBUG command should cause the creation of a MyHashMap with the
keys being all of the airport codes in the input file.
The goal is to see how many hash conflicts occur.  After filing the
MyHashMap, the program should call the printTable() method on MyHashMap.
The printTable() method should output how many conflicts occur at
each bucket and list the keys in that bucket.

Here is an example input file:
```
airline,airline ID, source airport, source airport id, destination apirport, destination airport id, codeshare, stops, equipment
3S,11741,PTP,2881,FDF,2878,,0,AT5 320
3S,11741,PTP,2881,SBH,6460,,0,DHT
3S,11741,PTP,2881,SDQ,1762,,0,AT5
3S,11741,PTP,2881,SFG,2879,,0,AT5
3S,11741,PTP,2881,SXM,2899,,0,AT5
3S,11741,SBH,6460,PTP,2881,,0,DHT
3S,11741,SDQ,1762,PTP,2881,,0,AT5
3S,11741,SDQ,1762,SXM,2899,,0,AT5
3S,11741,SFG,2879,PTP,2881,,0,AT5
3S,11741,SLU,2893,FDF,2878,,0,AT5
3S,11741,SXM,2899,DOM,2877,,0,AT5
3S,11741,SXM,2899,PTP,2881,,0,AT5
3S,11741,SXM,2899,SDQ,1762,,0,AT5
3U,4608,BHY,6351,XIY,3379,,0,321
3U,4608,CAN,3370,CKG,3393,,0,321 320
3U,4608,CAN,3370,CTU,3395,,0,321 320 330
3U,4608,CAN,3370,SPN,2244,,0,330
3U,4608,CGO,3375,CGQ,4380,,0,321
3U,4608,CGO,3375,CKG,3393,,0,321
```

Here is the output of the program when given this input file and
the DEBUG command.
```
Index 0: (1 conflicts), [CAN XIY ]
Index 1: (1 conflicts), [SPN SBH ]
Index 2: (0 conflicts), [SDQ ]
Index 3: (0 conflicts), [CKG ]
Index 4: (3 conflicts), [DOM SLU SFG PTP ]
Index 5: (0 conflicts), []
Index 6: (0 conflicts), [CTU ]
Index 7: (1 conflicts), [CGO BHY ]
Index 8: (1 conflicts), [SXM FDF ]
Index 9: (0 conflicts), [CGQ ]
Total # of conflicts: 7
```



## **EXTRA CREDIT**
If you provide a better hash function than the one listed above, 
meaning that you have fewer collisions on the full flight database than 
the provided hash function, you will be able to receive 5 points of 
extra credit on PA5.  Provide your README.md file with example 
DEBUG output to show that your hash function is better.  Also explain 
why your hash function is better.

## Grading Criteria

Half of the PA5 grade will be correctness.  For this assignment, there
will be some private test cases on Gradescope used for grading.

The other half of the PA5 grade will be your decomposition and code clarity
and the JUnit tests.

Decomposition
* Should carefully select data structures that implement the
  required MyHashMap functionality.  You cannot use the provided
  Java HashMap implementation or any other HashMap implementation
  written by someone else.

* Points will be taken off for copy, pasted, and edited code that
  should have been encapsulated in a method.

* This program will use two to three source files in addition to the 
  source file for the JUnit tests.  Each of these files should be (<200 lines).

* Each static method should be less than 30 lines.  This INCLUDES
  comments, but not the method header.  It is easier to read a 
  function if it can all fit on one screen.

* Make things as simple as possible.
  * Only use one Scanner instance.
  * Don't use lambda functions or other features in non-standard ways.
  * Avoid nested loops.
  * Avoid nesting conditionals.
  * Avoid chaining: see the Piazza post for more info


Code Clarity
* YOU should be able to read, understand, and explain your own code
  to someone else a couple days after you wrote it.
  * No magic numbers
  * No methods written to just get the test cases to work

* There needs to be a balance between no comments in the body of the
  methods and a comment for every line in the program.  Either extreme
  will result in points off.

* The file header should include instructions on how someone would
  use this program.  To use the program, one would need to know the
  input file format.

* Use meaningful variable names.  Loop iterators can
  be simple (i for integers, s for strings, n for numbers, etc.).

* The clearest code examples will be anonymously shown in class.

* The most obfuscated code examples will be anonymously shown in class
  with suggestions for improvement.


The coding style in terms of spacing, etc. should be done automatically
every time you save in Eclipse.  As long as you stick with those defaults,
the syntax style should be fine.


## Submission

Write your own code.  We will be using a tool that finds overly similar code.
This Spring 2018 semester in CS 210 we unfortunately have had academic
integrity cases.
I recommend that when talking with others about the assignment, do not write
anything down.


For PA5, you are **REQUIRED** to submit all of your java source files
to Gradescope.

There is NO Aropa submission for PA5.
